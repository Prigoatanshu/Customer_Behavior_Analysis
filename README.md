📊 Data Analytics Project — README
📝 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, including data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL querying across multiple database systems, dashboard building, and report creation. It also includes an automated presentation generated using Gamma.

📁 Dataset

The dataset is loaded in Python (CSV/Excel/other format).

Basic checks are performed (shape, missing values, data types).

Sensitive or proprietary data is excluded from the repository.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)

Power BI (Dashboard & Data Modeling)

Gamma (Automated slide deck generation)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code for development

🔧 Steps
1. Load the Dataset

Use Python to import and preview the dataset.

Validate column formats and handle inconsistent types.

2. Perform EDA

Summary statistics

Outlier detection

Trend, correlation, and distribution analysis

Visualizations for key insights

3. Clean the Data

Handle missing values

Fix or remove invalid entries

Standardize formats

Create derived features if needed

4. Run SQL Queries

Import the cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server

Run analytical SQL queries (JOINS, aggregations, window functions)

5. Build a Power BI Dashboard

Connect to the cleaned dataset

Design visuals showing KPIs, trends, and segmentation

Add filters, drill-throughs, and interactive elements

6. Create a Report

Summarize insights from EDA, SQL analysis, and dashboard visuals

Highlight business implications and recommendations

7. Build a Gamma Presentation

Auto-generate a clean slide deck based on the report

Include charts, KPIs, and commentary

📈 Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

KPI cards

Time-series trends

Category comparisons

Interactive slicers

Data-driven insights for stakeholders

✅ Results

Improved data quality through systematic cleaning

Clear visual story through dashboard and charts

Actionable insights derived from SQL and EDA

Professional slide deck ready for presentation
